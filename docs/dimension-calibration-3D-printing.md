# Dimension Calibration for 3D-Printed Parts

The following parts are manufactured using filament-deposition 3D-printing, and have critical dimensions that affect the imaging performance of the open-UST system:

- Deposition mould
- PZT alignment mould
- Housing

To make sure that these critical dimensions are achieved, calibration test pieces are used to estimate the required offsets.

Pages in this section are a work-in-progress, and will soon be populated with guidance on how to perform this calibration.
