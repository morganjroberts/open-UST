# Matching Layer Deposition


## PVA Deposition Mould Calibration
### Slot Width Calibration
The slot width must be calibrated to give a tight fit between the PZT elements and the matching layer deposition mould. This stops the PZT elements from rotating in their slots, which would make the matching layer thicker on one side of the PZT than the other.

* The standard width offsets are 0.08, 0.1, 0.12, 0.14mm
* The width offset depends on the layer height
* The width offset calibration part is a single 16-element row.
* It is evaluated by placing PZT elements into the slots and checking the tightness of fit manually and visually
* The ideal width offset is the tightest possible that

## Print Doctor Blade Coater

* Calculate the height of the deposition-mould rail above the glass build plate: raft height + part height
* Input this into the Parametric CAD file for the doctor blade coater
* 3D print the parts 
* Assemble the parts
