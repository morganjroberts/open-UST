# PZT Alignment Moulds

- The PZT alignment moulds have slots for accepting PZT elements.
- Width offsets are required to achieve a tight fit between the PZT element and the slot.
- Four stl files are included with different single-sided-width-offsets (sswo). A sswo is applied to each edge of the slot.
