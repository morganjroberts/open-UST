Ultrasound Tomography (UST) is an emerging but promising modality that produces images of the sound-speed and acoustic-absorption distributions in breast tissue. These properties are useful biomarkers for classifying healthy and abnormal tissue types. UST could perform better than mammography, since it generates 3D images instead of 2D images. UST is also non-ionising, requires no painful breast compression, and is cheaper than MRI. Challenges in UST Widespread clinical adoption requires shorter data acquisition and image reconstruction times, while maintaining accuracy. Work towards this goal means that new methods must be tested experimentally. There is a high barrier to entry for researchers starting UST experiments: UST hardware is not available off the shelf, and custom systems are expensive. open-UST The goal of the open-UST project is to lower the barrier to entry for experimental UST researchers. This research project is guided by three objectives: High accessibility for end users. Nominal acoustic behaviour that supports UST imaging research. Low inter-element variation (IEV) in acoustic behaviour. This work will support researchers to build their own UST systems in house, accelerating progress towards fast and accurate UST imaging. This documentation is part of the open-source hardware distribution. Features Simple equipment requirements: No specialist equipment required, only a 3D-printer, vacuum chamber and standard workshop tooling. Low material cost: ~\u00a32k (excluding DAQ hardware) for a 256-element system. Modular: Both 2D and 3D imaging setups can be configured.

The ends of each cable must be prepared by installing an insulation-displaement-contact (IDC) connector, and by terminating the copper braid. Cut Cable to Length Cut enough cable so that there is enough slack when the transducer modules are connected to the data acquisition system, and placed in the water tank. For this system, 2.3 m was the required length. Up to 122 mm of cable may need to be removed when the sheath length is adjusted (see below). To account for this the cables were cut oversized, to lengths of 2.5 m. Braid Preparation The cable braid is made from groups of strands that are woven together. To prevent the braid from becoming untangled later, each group of strands should be terminated with solder. Setup a soldering iron with a temperature of 350 \u00b0C and a small tip. Remove 25 mm of sheath using a scalpel. Bend the cable to put tension on the sheath. Use a fresh, sharp blade with light, shallow strokes. Take care not to cut the braid wires underneath the sheath. For a group of braid strands, use tweezers to pull the group free from the braid. Twist the end of the group together. Apply a small amount of solder to the end of the group of strands. Bend the group of strands down. Repeat for all groups of braid strands. Adjusting the Sheath Length The length of ribbon cable between the end of the sheath and the IDC connector should be 36 mm \\pm 5 mm. Deviations from this will make it difficult to install the cable into the transducer module later. The ribbon cable has a continuous split/bonded repeating pattern, where the split sections are 36 mm in length, and the bonded sections are 25 mm in length , detailed in 3M-3659-3_34-way-screened-round-ribbon-cable_datasheet.pdf ) The IDC connector is installed on the bonded section. The end of the sheath should be aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable). This will provide approximately 36 mm of cable between the end of the sheath and the IDC connector. Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Mark the transition point where the ribbon cable changes from split to bonded (moving towards the end of the cable) using a permenant marker. If this point is not visible, remove sheath in small increments until it is visible. There must be at least 10 mm of bonded section for installing the IDC connectors. If there is less than 6 mm, remove more sheath to find a new transition point. Make a mark 36 mm back from this transition point, using a permenant marker. Use a scalpel to remove the remaining sheath up to this mark. Pull back the braid to expose the foil. Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Verify that the end of the sheath is aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable). Installing the Connectors Orient the cable so that the red wire is on the right hand side. Pre-flatten the ribbon cable by folding it approximately 6 mm above the transition from split to bonded. Install the IDC clip underneath the cable. Install the IDC housing onto the IDC clip. Press the two parts together until the IDC contacts grip the ribbon cable. Make sure that the polarity indicator (embossed triangle) is on the right hand side. The tab should also be facing forwards. Make sure the individual conductors are well aligned with the clip indentations and the IDC contacts. Use a vice to compress the assembly until the IDC clip locks to the IDC housing. Use side cutters to trim the excess ribbon cable flush with the IDC connector. Test Continuity and Isolation The IDC connector installation should be verified at this point, to prevent further manufacture on a bad cable, which would have to be repeated once the fault is detected. Conductor continuity along the cable is tested, in addition to isolation between neighbouring conductors. Find a multimeter with probes that are compatible with the IDC socket. If necessary, incompatible multimeter probes can be modified: Cut 2 lengths of 120 mm solid core 28 awg wire. Wrap one end tightly around each multimeter probe, using a knot. Obtain two single header pins with 0.64 mm sqaure posts. Solder each pin to the other end of the wire. Cut a 120 mm length of heatshrink. Install the heatshrink and shrink it onto the extended probe. Hold the IDC connectors from each end of the cable in a vice. Make sure their orientation is the same. Use the multimeter probes to test continuity and isolation according to the pattern shown in diagram below. For continuous measurements the DC resistance should be < 1 \\Omega . For isolated measurements the DC resistance should be out-of-range. Sheath Surface Treatment for Bonding (Transducer End) During the coating process, an adhesive bond to the PVC cable sheath is required. It is difficult to bond to PVC, so an abrasive surface treatment is used to increase bond strength. Choose the end of the cable with the longest copper braid. This will be the transducer end of the cable. Pull the copper braid back over the IDC connector. Make a mark 36 mm from the end of the sheath using a permenant marker. Extend the mark around the sheath circumference. Use a 24 tpi hacksaw blade (or similar) to abrade the cable sheath. The shiny PVC surface should be completely removed. Surface treatment should be applied up to at least 10 mm from the end of the sheath. Pull the copper braid back over the sheath. Wrap the end of the sheath in electrical insulating tape. The tape width should be \\leq 14 mm. Copper Collar for Shield Termination (Plug End) Cut a rectangle of adhesive-backed copper foil using scissors. The final ength of the copper collar should be 30 mm. Wrap the copper foil around the sheath at the plug end of the cable, and rub the seam. Setup a soldering iron with a temperature of 380 \u00b0C and a large-area tip. Apply solder to the copper foil seam. Use tweezers to untangle the copper braid. Form 4 twisted bundles of copper braid, equally spaced around the cable circumference. Bend one of the bundles so that its base touches the copper foil. Pre-solder the base of a bundle. Cut the bundle so that it overlaps the copper foil by ~4 mm. Solder the trimmed bundle to the copper foil. Keep heating time to a minimum to avoid melting the PVC cable sheath. Repeat this process for all four bundles.","title":"Cable Preparation"},{"location":"cable-preparation/#cable-preparation","text":"A shielded round ribbon cable is used to connect each transducer module to the data acquisition system.

It is used during the deposition of the matching layers to scrape the tungsten-epoxy compound over the PZT elements. Set the Blade Height Note: This step is only required if a non-standard PZT thickness is being used: If the nominal PZT thickness is approximately equal to the default value of 1 mm, skip this step and use the default blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl files instead. During use, the angle of the blade is maintained by the support arm, which rides along the surface of the glass plate. For the support arm to have the correct vertical offset from the blade tip, the blade height must be defined as a parameter. The blade height should be equal to the thickness of the matching layer deposition mould. Open the QWML-deposition-mould.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360. Record the calculated_part_height value from the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, Open the doctor-blade-coater.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360, In the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, set the blade_height parameter to the same value as calculated_part_height . Export the blade holder and support arm as .stl files. Notes: This doctor blade coater is designed for a specific safety blade (RS PRO 546-758m, part ID XX in BOM). If a different blade is used, the blade dimensions should be updated in the Change Parameters menu. The default blade-angle parameter used is 45 degrees. Preliminary testing showed that steeper blade angles produce a rougher surface finish, and that shallower blade angles require excessive downwards pressure, which can lead to blade-flexing and non-uniform matching layer thickness. 3D-printing Load blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl into the Cura slicer software. Use the following print orientation, to make sure the blade-holding features are flat. Use the 'Select face to align to the build plate' function. Recomended Settings: Use 100% infill to make the blade-holder as stiff as possible, so that the blade can be clamped flat, PVA support required for blade-holder.stl but not for support-arm.stl . 0.2 mm layer thickness, Enable top support interface. Process the Blade-holder A smooth flat surface is required to clamp the blade without flexing, Use a scalpel to remove bumps created by the 3D-printer nozzle. Install Threaded Inserts Use a soldering iron set to 275 degC, Place the M3 threaded insert [part ID 0] on to the soldering iron tip, Place the insert into the hole and push gently, As the plastic melts, push the insert into the hole, making sure that the insert is properly aligned. Keeping pushing until the insert sits below the surface, Gently twist the solering iron to remove it. Once all the inserts are installed, remove the raised edge around the insert by scraping with a scalpel. Install the Safety Blade Degrease the blade using Isopropyl Alcohol and a paper towel. Attach the support-arm to the blade-holder using x2 of M3 x 12 mm screws [part ID 1]. Pre-install x4 of M3 x 6 mm screws [part ID 2] into the blade holder, leaving space for the blade. Use washers [part ID 3] for the two outermost screws near the blade tips. Slide the safety blade underneath the heads of the screws. Make sure the blade is fully seated against the registering features. Gently tighten the screws, using the lowest tension required to grip the blade. Overtightening will lead to blade flex. Look along the blade to check its straightness. If there is a visible bend, check that the screws are not overtightened, and that the clamping surfaces are flat and clean.

Calibrate the slot width for the PVA deposition mould, (offset calibration process described here ). 3D-print the PVA deposition mould for the current batch (orientation and slicer settings detailed in 3D-print-spec.pdf ). Allow the part to cool for 1 hour. Carefully remove the part from the glass build plate using a scalpel. Inspect the slots under a microscope. Remove any debris using a scalpel and an air duster. Prepare Deposition Tooling Manufacture the deposition tooling parts (further details here ). Remove debris from the deposition tooling parts using an air duster. Degrease the deposition tooling parts using a paper towel/foam swab and isopropyl alcohol. Use a foam swab to apply a coating of petroleum jelly to both sides of the steel gauge blocks, and to one side of each of the glass pieces. Wipe off the coating using a paper towel to leave only a very thin layer that has negligible thickness. Clamp the jig to the work surface using a small G-clamp. Place the glass base into its recess, with the greased side facing up. Install the coating rails and loosely install the M3 x 6 mm screws. Place the PVA deposition mould onto the glass plate, in the same orientation that it was 3D-printed. Install the retention clips and loosely install the M3 x 6 mm screws. Adjust the parts so that there is no gap between the rails and the PVA deposition mould. Tighten all the screws until the parts are fixed in place, but no further (to avoid flexing). Place strips of masking tape on the glass plate beside the rails, and on the retention clips. Prepare and Load PZT elements Note: PZT element electrodes are polarised, and come from the manufacturer with a polarity indicator (e.g. an ink marking). Polarity affects whether the PZT generates a positive or negative pressure wave when driven with a positive voltage pulse, and should be the same for all the elements in the array. Polarity errors can be identified during calibration, and corrected for with the driving voltage, but it is more convenient to make sure that the PZT elements are loaded into the deposition mould with the same polarity. Identify the PZT element ID for the first deposition mould slot position, and remove the PZT element from the PZT storage tray using tweezers. Find the side without a polarity indicator. This is the 'front electrode', and the composite will bond to this side. Under a microscope, lightly abrade the surface of the front electrode using a small piece of P2000 grit sandpaper held in a pair of forceps. Do not remove excessive material. Clean all faces of the PZT element using isopropyl alcohol and a foam swab. Use tweezers to place the clean PZT element into the deposition mould slot, with the front electrode facing up. Make sure the PZT element is in full contact with the glass plate. Repeat for all elements in the batch. Make sure that the location of each unique PZT ID within the deposition mould slots is recorded. Prepare Tungsten-Epoxy Composite First calculate the required mass of tungsten, resin and hardener. For one batch of 20 PZT elements, the required volume is 5 ml. For a tungsten-weight fraction of 86.7 %, the required quantities are: Component Mass [g] Tungsten powder 25.98 Araldite standard resin 2.18 Araldite standard hardener 1.74 Use the Matlab function tungstenPolymerRatio to calculate the masses needed for other volumes and compositions. Place a clean piece of paper on a digital balance (resolution 0.1 g or better), and tare it. Dispense the required mass of tungsten powder, place aside for later. Clean the glass mixing plate with isopropyl alcohol. Place the glass plate on the digital balance, and tare it. Dispense the required mass of resin. Tare the balance. Dispense the required mass of hardener. Remove the glass plate from the balance and clamp securely to the work surface. Use a flat scraper to combine the resin and hardener. Mix thoroughly for 5 minutes, making sure that all of the material is fully incorporated. Add the tungsten powder. Mix thoroughly for 15 minutes, making sure that the mixture is homogeneous. Frequently remove unmixed material from the scraper and the edges of the glass plate, using a safety blade, and combine it with the rest of the material. Blade Coating Composite Note: Only one coating stroke should be used. Practice this step first with an empty deposition mould to gain experience of how the composite behaves and how much is required. Clean the custom blade coater using a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol. Carefully place ~3 ml of composite above the first row of PZT elements, on the deposition mould. Do not allow the composite to touch the elements, as this can pull them up out of their slots. Place the blade coater down onto the rails so that the composite is underneath the tool. Slowly (~0.6 mm/s) drag the blade along the rails to coat the PZT elements with the composite. Make sure that even pressure is applied to the three points of contact between the blade coater and the rails/jig. At the end of the coating stroke, slowly detach the blade from the composite using a side-to-side motion. Remove the masking tape, being careful not to touch the coating layer. Remove the rails, being careful not to touch the coating layer. Use a paper towel and isopropyl alcohol to remove residue from the parts of the glass base previously covered by the rails and tape. Composite Compression Place the 2 clamp bases either side of the deposition mould. Install the M3 x 12 mm screws and tighten until the clamps are fixed in place, but no further (to avoid flexing). Use tweezers to place the steel gauge blocks in their recesses, either side of the deposition mould. Be very careful not to touch the coating layer. Use tweezers to place one edge of the glass lid down so that it touches both gauge blocks. Once it touches the composite, do not lift it up. Allow the glass to fall into place onto the gauge blocks. The greased side should be touching the composite. Fix the clamp bars to the clamp bases using M3 x 6 mm screws. Insert the M3 x 20 mm clamping screws into the clamp bar, and advance them so that they almost touch the glass lid. In sequence, compress the composite layer. Tighten the four screws a quarter-turn at a time, to apply even clamping pressure. Stop once the glass lid touches the gauge block. Label the glass lid with the batch ID using a permananent marker. Allow the composite to cure undisturbed for 24 hours. Note: During the manufacture of the transducers, there were major problems compressing the composite, due to the high viscosity of the composite. The high shear forces required were not achievable by clamping the glass plates, since they flexed and cracked. In future, thicker glass could be used, the clamping force could be spread over a larger area, and the blade coating thickness could be reduced. This custom tooling requires modification, which is an open issue on GitHub. Mould Removal Note: Residual PVA can be gently removed from between the PZT elements using a toothbrush. Do not use warm water or agressive agitation since this can damage the adhesive bond between the PZT and the composite. Dissasemble the coating tooling. Use a scalpel to gently release the PVA deposition mould from the glass base. Do not attempt to remove the glass lid. To dissolve the PVA deposition mould, place the glass-PZT-PVA assembly in a bath of room temperature water for ~36 hours. Place the glass lid on a flat surface with the PZT elements facing up. Use a scalpel to gently release the composite from the glass lid. Work slowly, from the outside inwards, from all directions. Matching Layer Trimming Note: Change the scalpel blade for a new sharp one every 10 elements. Place the composite-PZT assembly, with the rear electrodes facing up, on a flat surface under a microscope. Use a scalpel to isolate a PZT element by cutting it out from the assembly. Hold the PZT element down using plastic tweezers and use a scalpel to trim the composite flush with the edge on each side. Repeat this to remove composite from the ends of the PZT element. Rotate the PZT element so that the non-electroded side is facing up. Hold the PZT with tweezers, and use a scalpel to shave the excess composite away from the PZT. The hard PZT can be used as a guide for the scalpel blade to run along, to cut the softer composite flush with the surface. Repeat for the other non-electroded side of the PZT element. Place the PZT element back in the PZT storage tray. Repeat this process for all PZT elements. Matching Layer Thickness Measurement Measure the matched-PZT thickness using the method described earlier . Calculate the matching layer thickness for each element by subtracting the unmatched-PZT thickness from the matched-PZT thickness for each PZT ID. Expose the Front Electrode Setup the custom matching layer trimmer by adjusting the blade and depth-stop to the correct position. Remove a PZT element from the PZT storage tray using tweezers. Place the PZT element, matching layer facing down, onto the custom trimming tool, with one of the ends touching the depth stop. Use a soft push-stick (e.g. a pencil with eraser) to press the matching layer onto the blade. If the matching layer did not separate fully, bring the PZT element under a microscope. Use a scalpel blade to release the waste matching layer. Do not damage the electrode with the scalpel blade. Record any defects (PZT chipping, electrode damage, matching layer damage), for the current PZT ID. Return the PZT element to the PZT storage tray. Repeat this process for all PZT elements.","title":"Matching Layer Deposition"},{"location":"matching-layer-deposition/#matching-layer-deposition","text":"","title":"Matching Layer Deposition"},{"location":"matching-layer-deposition/#prepare-pva-deposition-mould","text":"From the width ordered list of PZT elements, select a batch of 20 PZT elements with a similar width, and make a list of their PZT ID's.

Polarity affects whether the PZT generates a positive or negative pressure wave when driven with a positive voltage pulse, and should be the same for all the elements in the array. Polarity errors can be identified during calibration, and corrected for with the driving voltage, but it is more convenient to make sure that the PZT elements are loaded into the deposition mould with the same polarity. Identify the PZT element ID for the first deposition mould slot position, and remove the PZT element from the PZT storage tray using tweezers. Find the side without a polarity indicator. This is the 'front electrode', and the composite will bond to this side. Under a microscope, lightly abrade the surface of the front electrode using a small piece of P2000 grit sandpaper held in a pair of forceps. Do not remove excessive material. Clean all faces of the PZT element using isopropyl alcohol and a foam swab. Use tweezers to place the clean PZT element into the deposition mould slot, with the front electrode facing up.

Use a scalpel to scrape flat the PCB mating face (the region between the two PCB alignment tabs). Test fit the PCB-housing assembly (with the header pin strip facing the housing), to verify that the mating faces are in full contact. Test that the hex nuts seat properly into the hex nut recesses. The hex nut should protrude from the surface by 2 mm. Discard the housing if this fetaure has a defect. Base Plate Setup It is required that the PZT elements are aligned perpendicularly to the top surface of the transducer housing. To achieve this, the PZT elements are placed in the PZT alignment mould to align them perpendicularly with the base plate, which acts as a reference plane. The top surface of the housing is parallel with the surface of the base plate, which in turn means that it is perpendicular to the PZT elements. The following adjustment procedure is required to make the top surface of the housing parallel with the surface of the base plate: Manufacture the base plate assembly (further details here ). Install M3 x 12 mm socket head screws into the threaded holes in the base plate. The initial height of the top of the socket head above the base plate should be approximately 8 mm. Measure this using digital calipers and adjust if necessary (1 rotation advances the M3 screw by 0.5 mm). Clip the PCB to the housing, and place the PCB flat against the base plate, with the housing resting on the socket screws. Push M5 x 30 mm screws through the clamp, into the threaded holes in the base plate. Tighten the screws to clamp the PCB-housing assembly to the base plate.

Use a fine paint brush to apply a bead of washable PVA glue onto the mating faces of each half of the rigid coating mould. Place the two halves of the mould either side of the transducer cable. Install 6 M3 x 20 mm socket head screws through part A, into the threads in part B, to clamp the split mould together. Use a foam swab to remove the PVA squeezeout inside the mould cavity, so that the internal mould seam is smooth. Allow the PVA adhesive to dry for 1 hour.

Dispense silicone sealant onto a sacrificial paper towel. Use a foam swab to plug all of the holes in the coating mould with silicone sealant. Use a gloved finger to seal the cable entry point to the mould with silicone sealant. A thick layer is needed since the PVC-silicone bond is weak. A thin coat could easily peel away when the transducer is handled. Allow the silicone sealant to cure for 4 hours.

Install M3 screws through the strongplate and into the coating mould-transducer assembly (part A should be facing the strongplate). Tighten the screws so that part A is pulled flat against the strongplate. Install the acoustic coating mould using M3 x 8 mm screws. Use a safety blade to test the transducer-mould alignment. The PCB should be level with the top surface of the acoustic coating mould. Remove the acoustic coating mould.

Note: Be careful not to touch the front face of the transducer with the epoxy. If this happens, remove it immediately and rinse thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol. Note: The pigment is for cosmetic purposes only. Omitting it will not affect the curing properties of the epoxy. Cast the coating using the following procedure: Use an air duster to remove debris from the front face of the transducer module. Use a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol to degrease the front face of the transducer module. Test the fit of the 15ga blunt needle in the coating cavity. If the needle is slightly too large, compress it in a vice until it fits. Tightly push the needle luer-slip fitting onto the 60 ml syringe barrel and remove the plunger. Calculate the required mass of resin, hardener and pigment. For four transducer modules, the required volume is 60 ml, and the required quantities are: Component Mass [g] Resin 44.68 Hardener 20.11 Pigment 6.48 Place a clean mixing pot on a digital balance (resolution 0.1 g or better), and tare it. Dispense the required mass of resin. Tare the balance. Dispense the required mass of hardener. Tare the balance. Dispense the required mass of pigment. Use a plastic rod to mix the components together for 5 minutes. Frequently scrape down the walls and bottom of the pot to make sure that all of the material is fully incorporated. Pour the mixture into the syringe barrel. Holding the syringe horiztonally, push the plunger into the syringe barrel until it forms a seal, but no further. Gently rotate the syringe so that it is vertical, with the needle facing up, and allow the mixture to settle and for the air to rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger to expell all of the air from the syringe. Place the needle into the coating mould cavity, as far down as it will go (it may be necessary to wiggle the needle if the fit is tight). Gently push the syringe plunger to dispense the epoxy into the mould. Once the epoxy has reached the top of the mould, gently remove the needle from the mould. Wait for 10 minutes to check that the epoxy is not internally into the transducer module, indicated by the level going down without visible external leaking (see note below). Place the acoustic coating mould over the exposed transducer module. Install 4 M3 x 8 mm screws to secure the acoustic coating mould to the rigid coating mould. Allow to cure for 24 hours. Note: If the epoxy is leaking internally, it will leak into the cable, making the cable rigid when the epoxy cures, which should be avoided. To stop a leak, use the needle and a new syringe to suck as much epoxy as possible out of the mould, wait for the epoxy to cure (this will seal the leak) and start the coating process again with a new batch of epoxy.","title":"Rigid Coating"},{"location":"rigid-coating/#rigid-coating","text":"","title":"Rigid Coating"},{"location":"rigid-coating/#seal-cable-transducer-entry-point","text":"Mount the transducer in the custom vertical clamp (further details here ), taking care not to damage the PZT elements during handling.

Dispense silicone sealant onto a sacrificial paper towel. Use a foam swab to plug all of the holes in the coating mould with silicone sealant. Use a gloved finger to seal the cable entry point to the mould with silicone sealant. A thick layer is needed since the PVC-silicone bond is weak. A thin coat could easily peel away when the transducer is handled.

Note: Be careful not to touch the front face of the transducer with the epoxy. If this happens, remove it immediately and rinse thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol. Note: The pigment is for cosmetic purposes only. Omitting it will not affect the curing properties of the epoxy. Cast the coating using the following procedure: Use an air duster to remove debris from the front face of the transducer module. Use a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol to degrease the front face of the transducer module. Test the fit of the 15ga blunt needle in the coating cavity. If the needle is slightly too large, compress it in a vice until it fits. Tightly push the needle luer-slip fitting onto the 60 ml syringe barrel and remove the plunger. Calculate the required mass of resin, hardener and pigment. For four transducer modules, the required volume is 60 ml, and the required quantities are: Component Mass [g] Resin 44.68 Hardener 20.11 Pigment 6.48 Place a clean mixing pot on a digital balance (resolution 0.1 g or better), and tare it. Dispense the required mass of resin. Tare the balance. Dispense the required mass of hardener. Tare the balance. Dispense the required mass of pigment. Use a plastic rod to mix the components together for 5 minutes. Frequently scrape down the walls and bottom of the pot to make sure that all of the material is fully incorporated. Pour the mixture into the syringe barrel. Holding the syringe horiztonally, push the plunger into the syringe barrel until it forms a seal, but no further. Gently rotate the syringe so that it is vertical, with the needle facing up, and allow the mixture to settle and for the air to rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger to expell all of the air from the syringe. Place the needle into the coating mould cavity, as far down as it will go (it may be necessary to wiggle the needle if the fit is tight). Gently push the syringe plunger to dispense the epoxy into the mould. Once the epoxy has reached the top of the mould, gently remove the needle from the mould. Wait for 10 minutes to check that the epoxy is not internally into the transducer module, indicated by the level going down without visible external leaking (see note below). Place the acoustic coating mould over the exposed transducer module. Install 4 M3 x 8 mm screws to secure the acoustic coating mould to the rigid coating mould. Allow to cure for 24 hours.
