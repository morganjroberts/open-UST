# Dimension Calibration for 3D-Printed Parts

The following parts are manufactured using filament-deposition 3D-printing, and have critical dimensions that affect the imaging performance of the open-UST system:

- Deposition mould
- PZT alignment mould
- Housing

To make sure that these critical dimensions are achieved, calibration test pieces are used to estimate the required offsets.

Pages in this section are a work-in-progress, and will soon be populated with guidance on how to perform this calibration.

## Deposition Mould
## PZT Alignment Mould
<!-- ## Calibrate Alignment Mould Slot Width
The slot width should be tuned for every transducer module. Slot width calibration should be performed immediately before printing the final alignmnet-mould for a given transducer module, because deviations in 3D-printer filament diameter can cause drift in 3D-printer linewidth over time.

The alignment mould slot width must be as close as possible to the width of the PZT elements. This is so that the PZT elements cannot rotate in their slots.

These other parameters must be controlled to minimise the gap between the PZT elements and the alignment mould, so that the PZT element location is well known:
- PCB offset
- slot corner radius
- slot length
- 

Tune the slot width:
- print `piece.stl`
- choose the two elements with the largest width
- insert the pzt elements into all of the slots. The element should seat easily into the slots without needing force, but it should not rotate in the slots. -->
