## Braid Preparation

The cable braid is made from groups of strands that are woven together. To prevent the braid from becoming untangled during manufacture later, each group of strands should be 

1. Remove 25 mm of sheath using a scalpel.
    - **Note:** Use a fresh, sharp blade with light, shallow strokes.
    - **Note:** Take care not to cut the braid wires underneath the sheath. 
    - **Note:** Bend the cable to put tension on the sheath.
2. For each group of braid strands (see video below):
    - Use tweezers to pull the group of strands free from the braid,
    - Twist the end of the group,
    - Apply a small amount of solder to the end of the group of strands,
    - Bend the group of strands backwards.

## Adjusting the Sheath Length

Motivation: we need to align the end of the sheath with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable).

1. Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable.
2. Mark the transition point where the ribbon cable changes from split to bonded (moving towards the end of the cable) using a permenant marker.
    - **Note:** If this point is not visible, remove sheath in small increments until it is visible (see video below).
    - **Note:** There must be at least 6mm of bonded section for installing the IDC connectors. If there is less than 6 mm, remove more sheath to find a new transition point.
3. Make a mark 36 mm back from this transition point, using a permenant marker
    - **Note:** This value is the length of the split sections, taken from the datasheet (XXX)
4. Use a scalpel to remove the remaining sheath up to this mark.
5. Pull back the braid to expose the foil.
6. Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Verify that the end of the sheath is aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable).
