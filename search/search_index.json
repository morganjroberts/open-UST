The ends of each cable must be prepared by installing an insulation-displaement-contact (IDC) connector, and by terminating the copper braid, Cut Cable to Length Cut enough cable so that there is enough slack when the transducer modules are connected to the data acquisition system, and placed in the water tank. For this system, 2.3 m was the required length. Up to 122 mm of cable may need to be removed when the sheath length is adjusted (see below). To account for this the cables were cut oversized, to lengths of 2.5 m. Braid Preparation The cable braid is made from groups of strands that are woven together. To prevent the braid from becoming untangled later, each group of strands should be terminated with solder. Remove 25 mm of sheath using a scalpel. Note: Use a fresh, sharp blade with light, shallow strokes. Note: Take care not to cut the braid wires underneath the sheath. Note: Bend the cable to put tension on the sheath. For each group of braid strands (see video below): Use tweezers to pull the group of strands free from the braid, Twist the end of the group, Apply a small amount of solder to the end of the group of strands, Bend the group of strands backwards. placeholder for video Adjusting the Sheath Length The length of ribbon cable between the end of the sheath and the IDC connector should be 36 mm \\pm 5 mm. Deviations from this will it difficult to install the cable into the transducer module later. The ribbon cable has a continuous split/bonded repeating pattern, where the split sections are 36 mm in length, and the bonded sections are 25 mm in length , detailed in 3M-3659-3_34-way-screened-round-ribbon-cable_datasheet.pdf ) The IDC connector is installed on the bonded section. The end of the sheath should be aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable). This will provide approximately 36 mm of cable between the end of the sheath and the IDC connector (see section below). Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Mark the transition point where the ribbon cable changes from split to bonded (moving towards the end of the cable) using a permenant marker. Note: If this point is not visible, remove sheath in small increments until it is visible (see video below). Note: There must be at least 10 mm of bonded section for installing the IDC connectors. If there is less than 6 mm, remove more sheath to find a new transition point. Make a mark 36 mm back from this transition point, using a permenant marker Note: This value is the length of the split sections, taken from the datasheet (XXX) Use a scalpel to remove the remaining sheath up to this mark. Pull back the braid to expose the foil. Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Verify that the end of the sheath is aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable). placeholder for video Installing the Connectors Hold the cable so that the red wire is on the right hand side. Pre-flatten the ribbon cable by folding it approximately 6mm above the transition from split to bonded. Install the IDC clip underneath the cable. Install the IDC housing onto the IDC clip. Press the two parts together until the IDC contacts grip the ribbon cable. Note: Make sure that the polarity indicator (embossed triangle) is on the right hand side. The tab should also be facing forwards. Note: Make sure the individual conductors are well aligned with the clip indentations and the IDC contacts. Use a vice to compress the assembly until the IDC clip locks to the IDC housing. Use side cutters to trim the excess ribbon cable flush with the IDC connector. Test Continuity and Isolation The quality of the IDC connector installation should be tested at this point, to prevent further manufacture on a bad cable, which would have to be repeated once the fault is detected. Conductor continuity along the cable is tested, in addition to isolation between neighbouring conductors. Find a multimeter with probes that are compatible with the IDC socket. If necessary, incompatible multimeter probes can be modified: Cut 2 lengths of 120 mm solid core 28 awg wire, Wrap one end tightly around each multimeter probe, using a knot, Obtain two single header pins with 0.64 mm sqaure posts (part in BOM) Solder each pin to the other end of the wire, Cut a 120 mm length of heatshrink (part in bOM) Install the heatshrink and shrink it onto the extended probe. Hold the IDC connectors from each end of the cable in a vice. Make sure their orientation is the same. Use the multimeter probes to test continuity and isolation according to the pattern shown in following diagram (also see video below): Note: for continuous measurements the DC resistance should be < 1 \\Omega . Note: for isolated measurements the DC resistance should be out-of-range. Sheath Surface Treatment for Bonding (Transducer End) During the coating process, an adhesive bond to the PVC cable sheath is required. It is difficult to bond to PVC, so a surface treatment is used to increase bond strength. Choose the end of the cable with the longest copper braid. This will be the transducer end of the cable. Pull the copper braid back over the IDC connector, Make a mark 36 mm from the end of the sheath using a permenant marker. Extend the mark around the sheath circumference. Use a 24 tpi hacksaw blade (or similar) to abrade the cable sheath (see video below) Note: The shiny PVC surface should be completely removed. Note: Surface treatment should be applied up to at least 10 mm from the end of the sheath. Pull the copper braid back over the sheath, Wrap the end of the sheath in electrical insulating tape Note: The tape width should be \\leq 14 mm. Sheath Copper Coating for Shield Termination (Plug End) Cut a XX mm by X mm rectangle of adhesive-backed copper foil using scissors. Wrap the copper foil around the plug end of the cable. Setup a soldering iron with a high temperature of 380 degC and a large-area tip. Apply solder to the copper foil seam. Use tweezers to untangle the copper braid. Form 4 twisted bundles of copper braid, equally spaced around the cable circumference. Bend one of the bundles so that its base touches the copper foil. Pre-solder the base of a bundle. Cut the bundle so that it overlaps the copper foil by ~ 4 mm. Solder the trimmed bundle to the copper foil. Keep heating time to a minimum to avoid melting the PVC cable sheath. Repeat this process for all four bundles.","title":"Cable Preparation"},{"location":"cable-preparation/#cable-preparation","text":"A shielded round ribbon cable is used to connect each transducer module to the data acquisition system.

It is used during the deposition of the matching layers to scrape the tungsten-epoxy compound over the PZT elements. Set the Blade Height Note: This step is only required if a non-standard PZT thickness is being used: If the nominal PZT thickness is approximately equal to the default value of 1 mm, skip this step and use the default blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl files instead. During use, the angle of the blade is maintained by the support arm, which rides along the surface of the glass plate. For the support arm to have the correct vertical offset from the blade tip, the blade height must be defined as a parameter. The blade height should be equal to the thickness of the matching layer deposition mould. Open the QWML-deposition-mould.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360. Record the calculated_part_height value from the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, Open the doctor-blade-coater.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360, In the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, set the blade_height parameter to the same value as calculated_part_height . Export the blade holder and support arm as .stl files. Notes: This doctor blade coater is designed for a specific safety blade (RS PRO 546-758m, part ID XX in BOM). If a different blade is used, the blade dimensions should be updated in the Change Parameters menu. The default blade-angle parameter used is 45 degrees.

Carefully remove the part from the glass build plate using a scalpel. Inspect the slots under a microscope. Remove any debris using a scalpel and an air duster. Prepare deposition tooling Remove debris from the deposition tooling parts using an air duster. Degrease the deposition tooling parts using a paper towel, foam swab and isopropyl alcohol. Use a foam swab to apply a coating of petroleum jelly to both sides of the steel gauge blocks, and to one side of each of the glass pieces. Wipe off the coating using a paper towel to leave only a very thin layer that has negligible thickness. Clamp the jig to the work surface using a small G-clamp. Place the glass base into its recess, with the greased side facing up. Place the PVA deposition mould onto the glass plate, in the same orientation that it was 3D-printed. Install the retention clips and loosely install the M3 x 6 mm screws. Install the coating rails and loosely install the M3 x 6 mm screws. Adjust the parts so that there is no gap between the rails and the PVA deposition mould. Tighten all the screws until the parts are fixed in place, but no further (to avoid flexing). Place strips of masking tape on the glass plate beside the rails, and on the retention clips. Prepare and load PZT elements Note: PZT element electrodes are polarised, and come from the manufacturer with a polarity indicator (e.g. an ink marking). Polarity affects whether the PZT generates a positive or negative pressure wave when driven with a positive voltage pulse, and should be the same for all the elements in the array. Although their polarity can be identified during calibration, and corrected for with the driving voltage, it is more convenient to make sure that the PZT elements are loaded into the deposition mould with the same polarity. Identify the PZT element ID for the first position, and remove the PZT element from the PZT tray using tweezers. Find the side without a polarity indicator. This is the 'front electrode', and the composite will bond to this side. Under a microscope, lightly abrade the surface of the front electrode using a small piece of P2000 grit sandpaper held in a pair of forceps. Do not remove excessive material, Clean all faces of the PZT element using isopropyl alcohol and a foam swab. Use tweezers to place the clean PZT element into the deposition mould slots, with the front electrode facing up. Make sure the PZT element is in full contact with the glass plate. Prepare tungsten-epoxy composite MAKE SURE THIS MIRRORS THE BACKING LAYER SECTIOJN Calculate the required mass of tungsten, resin and hardener. For four transducer modules, the required volume is XXX ml. For a tungsten-weight fraction of 86.9 %, the required quantities are: Component Mass [g] Tungsten powder Araldite standard resin Araldite standard hardener Use the matlab function XXX to calculate the masses needed for other volumes and compositions. Place a clean piece of paper on a digital balance (resolution 0.1 g or better), and tare it, Dispense the required mass of tungsten powder, place aside for later, Clean the glass mixing plate with isopropyl alcohol, Place the glass plate on the digital balance, and tare it, Dispense the required mass of resin, Tare the balance, Dispense the required mass of hardener, Remove the glass plate from the balance and clamp securely to the work surface, Use a flat scraper to combine the resin and hardener. Mix thoroughly for 5 minutes, making sure that all of the material is fully incorporated. Add the tungsten powder. Mix thoroughly for 15 minutes, making sure that the mixture is homogeneous. Frequently remove unmixed material from the scraper blade and the edges of the glass plate and combine it with the rest of the material. Blade coating composite Note: practice this step Clean the custom blade coater using a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol. Carefully place ~ 3 ml of composite above the first row of PZT elements, on the deposition mould. Do not allow the composite to touch the elements, as this can pull them up out of their slots. Place the blade coater down onto the rails so that the composite is underneath the tool. Slowly (~0.6 mm/s) drag the blade along the rails to coat the PZT elements with the composite. Make sure that even pressure is applied to the three points of contact between the blade coater and the rails/jig. At the end of the coating stroke, slowly detach the blade from the composite using a side-to-side position. Remove the masking tape, being careful not to touch the coating layer. Remove the rails, being careful not to touch the coating layer. Use a paper towel and isopropyl alcohol to remove residue from the parts of the glass base previously covered by the rails and tape. Composite compression Place the 2 clamp bases either side of the deposition mould. Install the M3 x 12 mm screws and tighten until the clamps are fixed in place, but no further (to avoid flexing). Use tweezers to place the steel gauge blocks in their recesses, either side of the deposition mould. Be very careful not to touch the coating layer. Use tweezers to place one edge of the glass lid down so that it touches both gauge blocks. Once it touches the composite, do not lift it up. Allow it to fall into place onto the gauge blocks. The greased side should be touching the composite. Fix the clamp bars to the clamp bases using M3 x 6 mm screws. Insert the M3 x 20 mm screws into the clamp bar, and advance them so that they almost touch the glass lid. In sequence, compress the composite layer. Tighten the four screws a quarter-turn at a time, to apply even clamping pressure. Stop once the glass lid touches the gauge block. Label the glass lid with the batch ID using a permananent marker. Allow the composite to cure undisturbed for 24 hours. Note: during the manufacture of UST-001, there were major problems compressing the composite, since the thin 1 mm glass coverslips flexed and cracked before it made proper contact with the gauge blocks. This custom tooling needs a redesign which is an open issue on GitHub. Mould removal Dissasemble the coating tooling. Use a scalpel to gently release the PVA deposition mould from the glass base. Do not attempt to remove the glass lid. To dissolve the PVA deposition mould, place the glass-PZT-PVA assembly in a bath of room temperature water for ~36 hours. Note: residual PVA can be gently removed from between the PZT elements using a toothbrush. Do not use warm water or agressive agitation since this can damage the adhesive bond between the PZT and the composite. Place the glass lid on a flat surface with the PZT elements facing up. Use a scalpel to gently release the composite from the glass lid. Work slowly, from the outside inwards, from all directions. Matching layer trimming Note: change the scalpel blade for a new sharp one every 10 elements. Place the composite-PZT assembly, with the rear electrodes facing up, on a flat surface under a microscope. Use a scalpel to isolate a PZT element by cutting it out from the assembly. Hold the PZT element down using plastic tweezers and use a scalpel to trim the composite flush with the edge on each side. Repeat this to remove composite from the ends of the PZT element. Rotate the PZT element so that the non-electroded side is facing up. Hold the PZT with tweezers, and use a scalpel to shave the excess composite away from the PZT. The hard PZT can be used as a guide for the scalpel blade to run along, to cut the softer composite flush with the surface. Repeat for the other non-electroded side of the PZT element. Place the PZT element back in the PZT storage tray. Repeat this process for all PZT elements. Thickness measurement Repeat the thickness measurement described in XXX. Expose the front electrode Setup the custom matching layer trimmer by adjusting the blade and depth-stop to the correct position. Remove a PZT element from the PZT storage tray. Place the PZT element, matching layer facing down, onto the custom trimming tool, with one of the ends touching the depth stop. Use a soft push-stick (e.g. a pencil with eraser) to press the matching layer onto the blade. If the matching layer did not separate fully, bring the PZT element under a microscope. Use a scalpel blade to release the waste matching layer. Do not damage the elctrode with the scalpel blade. Record any defects (chipping, electrode damage, matching layer damage) in the XXX spreadsheet. Return the PZT element to the PZT storage tray. Repeat this process for all PZT elements.","title":"Matching Layer Deposition"},{"location":"matching-layer-deposition/#matching-layer-deposition","text":"","title":"Matching Layer Deposition"},{"location":"matching-layer-deposition/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"matching-layer-deposition/#prepare-pva-deposition-mould","text":"Using the width ordered list of PZT elements, select a batch of 20 PZT elements with a similar width Calibrate the slot width for the PVA deposition mould, (detialed fuether in XXX) 3D-print the PVA deposition mould (setting desiebd in) Allow the part to cool for 1 hour.

The height of the top of the socket head above the base plate should be approximately 8 mm. Measure this using digital calipers and adjust if necessary (1 rotation advances the M3 screw by 0.5 mm).

Bend the sides around the pliers to form an overall angle of approximately 90 degrees. Re-position the pliers to cover one of the holes. Bend the wing to an angle of approximately 45 degrees Repeat for the other wing. placeholder for final image and video","title":"Strain Relief Clip Manufacture"},{"location":"strain-relief-clip-manufacture/#strain-relief-clip-manufacture","text":"","title":"Strain Relief Clip Manufacture"},{"location":"strain-relief-clip-manufacture/#overview","text":"The strain relief clips are used to: * secure the cable to the transducer module housing, * secure the cable to the plug backshell.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"strain-relief-clip-manufacture/#mark-hole-and-outline-locations","text":"Download and print the template placeholder Cut a piece of 0.2 mm steel shim stock slightly larger than the template printout.
