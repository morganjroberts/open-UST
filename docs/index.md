# open-UST

This is the documentation for the [open-UST](https://github.com/morganjroberts/open-UST) hardware distribution: an open source manufacturing framework for a low-cost, modular Ultrasound Tomography (UST) research system.

This documentation, and the hardware github repository, are both being actively updated. 

Additional documentation and hardware files are being added so that open-UST can be used 'out-of-the-box'.

Read more about UST and the motivation for this work [here](background.md).
