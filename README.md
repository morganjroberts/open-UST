# **open-UST:** An Open Source Manufacturing Framework for a Low-cost Ultrasound Tomography Research System.

There is a high barrier to entry for researchers starting ultrasound tomography (UST) experiments: UST hardware is not available off the shelf, and custom systems are expensive.
The goal of the open-UST project is to **lower the barrier to entry for experimental UST researchers**, by providing a manufacturing framework that allows end users to build their own UST transducers in-house.

</p>

open-UST is part of an ongoing research project, guided by three objectives:

1. High accessibility for end users.
2. Nominal acoustic behaviour that supports UST imaging research.
3. Low inter-element variation (IEV) in acoustic behaviour.

## Features

- **Simple equipment requirements:** No specialist equipment required, only a 3D-printer, vacuum chamber and standard workshop tooling.
- **Low material cost:** ~Â£2k (excluding DAQ hardware) for a 256-element system.
- **Modular:** Both 2D and 3D imaging setups can be configured. 
- **Low interelement variation**: Recent testing showed that the individual sensing elements have uniform acoustic behaviour.
- **Other:**
  - Fully waterproof
  - Electromagnetically shielded
  - Transducer modules feature threaded mounting points for repeatable positioning
  - Includes option for a modular interface with the ITT Cannon DL5-260P connector (compatible with Verasonics)
