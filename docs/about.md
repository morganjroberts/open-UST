##  Ultrasound Tomography
Breast cancer screening with mammograms reduces mortality, but false negatives can occur for people with high breast density [1], and over-diagnosis causes harm in healthy people [2]. Ultrasound Tomography (UST) is an emerging but promising modality that produces sound-speed and acoustic-absorption distributions in breast tissue, which are useful biomarkers for classifying tissue types [3]. UST is also non-ionising, requires no painful breast compression, and is cheaper than MRI.

## Challenges in UST
Initial clinical performance has been promising [4], but widespread adoption requires shorter acquisition and reconstruction times, while maintaining accuracy. Work towards this goal requires experimental validation of new methods, but there is a high barrier to entry for researchers starting UST experiments, since UST hardware is not available off the shelf, and custom systems are expensive.

## open-UST
To address this, the open-UST [5] project is being developed to support the in-house manufacture of UST research systems. The open-source hardware distribution includes CAD models, PCB and 3D-printing files, a bill of materials, assembly videos, and documentation of manufacture procedures. The standard open-UST configuration is a 220 mm 256-element 2D ring array, constructed from 16 linear modules, shown in Figure 1. The material cost is low (Â£2,500 excluding DAQ hardware), and the manufacture does not require specialist equipment. At UCL, half of a standard open-UST array has been manufactured for testing, shown in Figure 1, comprising 8 transducer modules (128 elements). The second half is currently being manufactured.
