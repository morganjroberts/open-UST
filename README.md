# **open-UST:** An Open Source Manufacturing Framework for a Low-cost Ultrasound Tomography Research System.

The goal of the open-UST project is to lower the barrier to entry for experimental ultrasound tomography UST researchers. 

The open source hardware distribution supports end users to manufacture a UST transducer array in-house:

</p>

## Features

**Simple end-user requirements:** No specialist equipment required, only a 3D-printer and vacuum chamber
**Low material cost:** ~Â£2,500 (excluding DAQ hardware) for a 256-element system
**Modular:** Both 2D and 3D imaging setups can be configured. Modules feature threaded mounting points for repeatable positioning
**Durable:** Transducers are fully waterproof
**Low interelement variation**: Recent testing showed that the individual sensing elements have uniform acoustic behaviour
