It is used during the deposition of the matching layers to scrape the tungsten-epoxy compound over the PZT elements. Set the Blade Height Note: This step is only required if a non-standard PZT thickness is being used: If the nominal PZT thickness is approximately equal to the default value of 1 mm, skip this step and use the default blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl files instead. During use, the angle of the blade is maintained by the support arm, which rides along the surface of the glass plate. For the support arm to have the correct vertical offset from the blade tip, the blade height must be defined as a parameter. The blade height should be equal to the thickness of the matching layer deposition mould. Open the QWML-deposition-mould.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360. Record the calculated_part_height value from the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, Open the doctor-blade-coater.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360, In the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, set the blade_height parameter to the same value as calculated_part_height . Export the blade holder and support arm as .stl files. Notes: This doctor blade coater is designed for a specific safety blade (RS PRO 546-758m, part ID XX in BOM). If a different blade is used, the blade dimensions should be updated in the Change Parameters menu. The default blade-angle parameter used is 45 degrees. Preliminary testing showed that steeper blade angles produce a rougher surface finish, and that shallower blade angles require excessive downwards pressure, which can lead to blade-flexing and non-uniform matching layer thickness. 3D-printing Load blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl into the Cura slicer software. Use the following print orientation, to make sure the blade-holding features are flat. Use the 'Select face to align to the build plate' function. Recomended Settings: Use 100% infill to make the blade-holder as stiff as possible, so that the blade can be clamped flat, PVA support required for blade-holder.stl but not for support-arm.stl . 0.2 mm layer thickness, Enable top support interface. Process the Blade-holder A smooth flat surface is required to clamp the blade without flexing, Use a scalpel to remove bumps created by the 3D-printer nozzle. Install Threaded Inserts Use a soldering iron set to 275 degC, Place the M3 threaded insert [part ID 0] on to the soldering iron tip, Place the insert into the hole and push gently, As the plastic melts, push the insert into the hole, making sure that the insert is properly aligned. Keeping pushing until the insert sits below the surface, Gently twist the solering iron to remove it. Once all the inserts are installed, remove the raised edge around the insert by scraping with a scalpel. Install the Safety Blade Degrease the blade using Isopropyl Alcohol and a paper towel. Attach the support-arm to the blade-holder using x2 of M3 x 12 mm screws [part ID 1]. Pre-install x4 of M3 x 6 mm screws [part ID 2] into the blade holder, leaving space for the blade. Use washers [part ID 3] for the two outermost screws near the blade tips. Slide the safety blade underneath the heads of the screws. Make sure the blade is fully seated against the registering features. Gently tighten the screws, using the lowest tension required to grip the blade. Overtightening will lead to blade flex. Look along the blade to check its straightness. If there is a visible bend, check that the screws are not overtightened, and that the clamping surfaces are flat and clean.

In this section, these characteristics are measured and recorded. This information is used to select which elements should be used for the transducer modules. The data can also be useful when interpretting inter-element variations in acoustic performance. It is helpful to measure the dimensions of the PZT elements before depositing the matching layers: The actual PZT dimensions will differ from the nominal values given on the datasheet (tolerances provided by the manufacturer for these PZT elements were \\pm 130 \\mu m for width and \\pm 25 \\mu m for thickness, detailed in: Piezoelectric Element Tolerances - APC International.pdf ) Knowing the distribution of element widths and thicknesses is useful for calibrating the slot widths and depths in the matching layer deposition mould. If the unmatched and matched PZT element thicknesses are measured, these can be used to estimate the matching layer thicknesses. Manufacture and Load the PZT Element Tray To store and keep track of the PZT elements, a gridded tray has been designed. This is accompanied by spreadsheet XXX, where the data rows and columns correspond to the physical rows and column locations on the PZT element tray. From now on, each PZT element should be identified by its row/column location e.g. 'A/3'. Note: The default stl file is PZT Element Tray 16x17 10 mm length.stl , which is a 16 \\times 17 grid, supporting 272 PZT bars of dimensions 1 mm \\times 1 mm \\times 10 mm. To design a tray for more elements, or for elements with different dimensions, open the pzt-element-tray.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360 and edit the Nrows, Ncolumns, hole_diameter, pzt_element_length parameters in the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu. Print the stl file with these settings: Low infill < 20% (non-structural) Coarse layer height 0.2 mm No support required Preview the part and make sure the holes are empty Install the threaded inserts into the holes using a soldering iron set to 275 ^{\\circ} C (adjust as necessary for non-PLA filaments), Manufacture a perspex lid with 4 mm clearance holes. If using the default stl file, the PZT Element Tray Drawing.pdf drawing can be printed out at 100% size to help mark out the hole pattern. Label the rows with numbers and columns with letters using a permenant marker. Load the tray with PZT elements. Use M3 x 12 mm screws to secure the lid to the tray during storage (part ID XXX in BOM). Dress the PZT Electrode Edges, Assess Defects During manufacture the individual PZT bars are cut from a large slab. Sometimes the silver electrodes are not cut neatly to the edge of the PZT. The excess PZT electrode material can fold over onto itself during shipping and handling. The excess electrode can affect the thickness measurement of the PZT elements and can prevent the PZT elements from seating properly on the bottom face of the slots in the PVA mould during matching layer deposition. To fix this, the electrode edges should be \"dressed\" by scraping away the excess electrode material. Note: Perform this work underneath a microscope. For each PZT element: Remove the PZT element from the tray using tweezers. Hold the PZT element on a flat clean surface with the electrode facing upwards. Use a scalpel blade (Swann-Morton No.11) to gently chamfer the edges of the electrodes. Do not apply excessive downwards pressure with the scalpel. Do not touch the face of the electrode with the scalpel. placeholder for video Assess the PZT element for any defects. Possible defects are chipping (C), electrode delamination (E), sliced electrode (S). Record these defects in spreadsheet XXX. Meaure the PZT Element Dimensions Setup a micrometer (this project used Mituyo XXX) securely in a clamp on a workbench. Clean the micrometer anvils using a foam swab (part ID XXX in BOM) and acetone. If using a digital micrometer, calibrate/tare it to 0. For each PZT element: Carefully handle the PZT element using tweezers (plastic if possible) Clean the PZT element using a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol. Align the PZT element so that the electroded faces are parallel with the micrometer anvils. Turn the ratcheting (rear-most) micrometer screw until it clicks. Record the thickness measurement. Rotate the element so that the non-electroded faces are parallel with the micrometer anvils. Record the PZT element width. Gently drop the PZT element into the correct location in the PZT element tray, being careful not to scrape the PZT element against the hole wall. Note: Re-clean the micrometer anvils using a foam swab and acetone every 10 PZT elements. placeholder for video Example Data Width and thickness distributions were measured from the PZT elements (N = 288) used for this project, using the procedure detailed above.
