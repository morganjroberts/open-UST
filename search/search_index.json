The ends of each cable must be prepared by installing an insulation-displaement-contact (IDC) connector, and by terminating the copper braid, Cut Cable to Length Cut enough cable so that there is enough slack when the transducer modules are connected to the data acquisition system, and placed in the water tank. For this system, 2.3 m was the required length. Up to 122 mm of cable may need to be removed when the sheath length is adjusted (see below). To account for this the cables were cut oversized, to lengths of 2.5 m. Braid Preparation The cable braid is made from groups of strands that are woven together. To prevent the braid from becoming untangled later, each group of strands should be terminated with solder. Remove 25 mm of sheath using a scalpel. Note: Use a fresh, sharp blade with light, shallow strokes. Note: Take care not to cut the braid wires underneath the sheath. Note: Bend the cable to put tension on the sheath. For each group of braid strands (see video below): Use tweezers to pull the group of strands free from the braid, Twist the end of the group, Apply a small amount of solder to the end of the group of strands, Bend the group of strands backwards. placeholder for video Adjusting the Sheath Length The length of ribbon cable between the end of the sheath and the IDC connector should be 36 mm \\pm 5 mm. Deviations from this will it difficult to install the cable into the transducer module later. The ribbon cable has a continuous split/bonded repeating pattern, where the split sections are 36 mm in length, and the bonded sections are 25 mm in length , detailed in 3M-3659-3_34-way-screened-round-ribbon-cable_datasheet.pdf ) The IDC connector is installed on the bonded section. The end of the sheath should be aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable). This will provide approximately 36 mm of cable between the end of the sheath and the IDC connector (see section below). Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Mark the transition point where the ribbon cable changes from split to bonded (moving towards the end of the cable) using a permenant marker. Note: If this point is not visible, remove sheath in small increments until it is visible (see video below). Note: There must be at least 10 mm of bonded section for installing the IDC connectors. If there is less than 6 mm, remove more sheath to find a new transition point. Make a mark 36 mm back from this transition point, using a permenant marker Note: This value is the length of the split sections, taken from the datasheet (XXX) Use a scalpel to remove the remaining sheath up to this mark. Pull back the braid to expose the foil. Use a scalpel to remove the foil, exposing the ribbon cable. Verify that the end of the sheath is aligned with the point where the ribbon cable changes from bonded to split (moving towards the end of the cable). placeholder for video Installing the Connectors Hold the cable so that the red wire is on the right hand side. Pre-flatten the ribbon cable by folding it approximately 6mm above the transition from split to bonded. Install the IDC clip underneath the cable. Install the IDC housing onto the IDC clip. Press the two parts together until the IDC contacts grip the ribbon cable. Note: Make sure that the polarity indicator (embossed triangle) is on the right hand side. The tab should also be facing forwards. Note: Make sure the individual conductors are well aligned with the clip indentations and the IDC contacts. Use a vice to compress the assembly until the IDC clip locks to the IDC housing. Use side cutters to trim the excess ribbon cable flush with the IDC connector. Test Continuity and Isolation The quality of the IDC connector installation should be tested at this point, to prevent further manufacture on a bad cable, which would have to be repeated once the fault is detected. Conductor continuity along the cable is tested, in addition to isolation between neighbouring conductors. Find a multimeter with probes that are compatible with the IDC socket. If necessary, incompatible multimeter probes can be modified: Cut 2 lengths of 120 mm solid core 28 awg wire, Wrap one end tightly around each multimeter probe, using a knot, Obtain two single header pins with 0.64 mm sqaure posts (part in BOM) Solder each pin to the other end of the wire, Cut a 120 mm length of heatshrink (part in bOM) Install the heatshrink and shrink it onto the extended probe. Hold the IDC connectors from each end of the cable in a vice. Make sure their orientation is the same. Use the multimeter probes to test continuity and isolation according to the pattern shown in following diagram (also see video below): Note: for continuous measurements the DC resistance should be < 1 \\Omega . Note: for isolated measurements the DC resistance should be out-of-range. Sheath Surface Treatment for Bonding (Transducer End) During the coating process, an adhesive bond to the PVC cable sheath is required. It is difficult to bond to PVC, so a surface treatment is used to increase bond strength. Choose the end of the cable with the longest copper braid, Pull the copper braid back over the IDC connector, Make a mark 36 mm from the end of the sheath using a permenant marker. Extend the mark around the sheath circumference. Use a 24 tpi hacksaw blade (or similar) to abrade the cable sheath (see video below) Note: The shiny PVC surface should be completely removed. Note: Surface treatment should be applied up to at least 10 mm from the end of the sheath.

It is used during the deposition of the matching layers to scrape the tungsten-epoxy compound over the PZT elements. Set the Blade Height Note: This step is only required if a non-standard PZT thickness is being used: If the nominal PZT thickness is approximately equal to the default value of 1 mm, skip this step and use the default blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl files instead. During use, the angle of the blade is maintained by the support arm, which rides along the surface of the glass plate. For the support arm to have the correct vertical offset from the blade tip, the blade height must be defined as a parameter. The blade height should be equal to the thickness of the matching layer deposition mould. Open the QWML-deposition-mould.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360. Record the calculated_part_height value from the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, Open the doctor-blade-coater.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360, In the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu, set the blade_height parameter to the same value as calculated_part_height . Export the blade holder and support arm as .stl files. Notes: This doctor blade coater is designed for a specific safety blade (RS PRO 546-758m, part ID XX in BOM). If a different blade is used, the blade dimensions should be updated in the Change Parameters menu. The default blade-angle parameter used is 45 degrees. Preliminary testing showed that steeper blade angles produce a rougher surface finish, and that shallower blade angles require excessive downwards pressure, which can lead to blade-flexing and non-uniform matching layer thickness. 3D-printing Load blade-holder.stl and support-arm.stl into the Cura slicer software. Use the following print orientation, to make sure the blade-holding features are flat. Use the 'Select face to align to the build plate' function.

Keeping pushing until the insert sits below the surface, Gently twist the solering iron to remove it. Once all the inserts are installed, remove the raised edge around the insert by scraping with a scalpel. Install the Safety Blade Degrease the blade using Isopropyl Alcohol and a paper towel. Attach the support-arm to the blade-holder using x2 of M3 x 12 mm screws [part ID 1]. Pre-install x4 of M3 x 6 mm screws [part ID 2] into the blade holder, leaving space for the blade. Use washers [part ID 3] for the two outermost screws near the blade tips. Slide the safety blade underneath the heads of the screws. Make sure the blade is fully seated against the registering features. Gently tighten the screws, using the lowest tension required to grip the blade. Overtightening will lead to blade flex.

Also, some elements will have defects. In this section, these characteristics are measured and recorded. This information is important for several reasons: Defect classifications will be used later to select which elements should be used for the transducer modules. The distribution of element widths and thicknesses is needed for calibrating the slot widths and depths in the matching layer deposition mould. If the unmatched and matched PZT element thicknesses are measured, these can be used to estimate the matching layer thicknesses (this data can be useful when interpretting inter-element variations in acoustic performance). Manufacture and Load the PZT Element Tray To store and keep track of the PZT elements, a gridded tray has been designed. This is accompanied by spreadsheet pzt-element-dimensions-defects.xlsx , where the data rows and columns correspond to the physical row and column locations on the PZT element tray. From now on, each PZT element should be identified by its row/column location e.g. 'A/3'. Note: The default stl file is PZT Element Tray 16x17 10 mm length.stl , which is a 16 \\times 17 grid, supporting 272 PZT bars of dimensions 1 mm \\times 1 mm \\times 10 mm. To design a tray for more elements, or for elements with different dimensions, open the pzt-element-tray.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360 and edit the Nrows, Ncolumns, hole_diameter, pzt_element_length parameters in the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu.

If using the default stl file, the PZT Element Tray Drawing.pdf drawing can be printed out at 100% size to help mark out the hole pattern. Label the rows with numbers and columns with letters using a permenant marker. Load the tray with PZT elements. Use M3 x 12 mm screws to secure the lid to the tray during storage (part ID XXX in bill-of-materials.xlsx ). Dress the PZT Electrode Edges, Assess Defects During manufacture the individual PZT bars are cut from a large slab. Sometimes the silver electrodes are not cut neatly to the edge of the PZT. The excess PZT electrode material can fold over onto itself during shipping and handling. The excess electrode can affect the thickness measurement of the PZT elements and can prevent the PZT elements from seating properly on the bottom face of the slots in the PVA mould during matching layer deposition. To fix this, the electrode edges should be \"dressed\" by scraping away the excess electrode material. Note: Perform this work underneath a microscope. For each PZT element: Remove the PZT element from the tray using tweezers. Hold the PZT element on a flat clean surface with the electrode facing upwards. Use a scalpel blade (Swann-Morton No.11) to gently chamfer the edges of the electrodes. Do not apply excessive downwards pressure with the scalpel. Do not touch the face of the electrode with the scalpel. placeholder for video Assess the PZT element for any defects. Possible defects are chipping (C), electrode delamination (E), sliced electrode (S), broken (B). Record these defects in spreadsheet pzt-element-dimensions-defects.xlsx . Note: This defect classification is not final, since some PZT elements will become damaged during manufacture. Meaure the PZT Element Dimensions Setup a micrometer securely in a clamp on a workbench. Clean the micrometer anvils using a foam swab (part ID XXX in bill-of-materials.xlsx ) and isopropyl alcohol (part ID XXX in bill-of-materials.xlsx ). If using a digital micrometer, calibrate/tare it to 0. For each PZT element: Carefully handle the PZT element using tweezers (plastic to avoid electrode scratching) Clean the PZT element using a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol. Align the PZT element so that the electroded faces are parallel with the micrometer anvils. Turn the ratcheting (rear-most) micrometer screw until it clicks. Record the PZT element thickness Rotate the element so that the non-electroded faces are parallel with the micrometer anvils. Record the PZT element width Gently drop the PZT element into the correct location in the PZT element tray, being careful not to scrape the PZT element against the hole wall. Note: Re-clean the micrometer anvils using a foam swab and isopropyl alcohol every 10 PZT elements. placeholder for video Example Data Width and thickness distributions were measured from the pool of PZT elements (N = 288) used for this project, using the procedure detailed above.

The distribution of element widths and thicknesses is needed for calibrating the slot widths and depths in the matching layer deposition mould. If the unmatched and matched PZT element thicknesses are measured, these can be used to estimate the matching layer thicknesses (this data can be useful when interpretting inter-element variations in acoustic performance).","title":"PZT Element Preparation"},{"location":"pzt-element-preparation/#manufacture-and-load-the-pzt-element-tray","text":"To store and keep track of the PZT elements, a gridded tray has been designed. This is accompanied by spreadsheet pzt-element-dimensions-defects.xlsx , where the data rows and columns correspond to the physical row and column locations on the PZT element tray. From now on, each PZT element should be identified by its row/column location e.g. 'A/3'. Note: The default stl file is PZT Element Tray 16x17 10 mm length.stl , which is a 16 \\times 17 grid, supporting 272 PZT bars of dimensions 1 mm \\times 1 mm \\times 10 mm. To design a tray for more elements, or for elements with different dimensions, open the pzt-element-tray.f3d CAD file in Fusion 360 and edit the Nrows, Ncolumns, hole_diameter, pzt_element_length parameters in the Solid > Modify > Change Parameters menu.

If using the default stl file, the PZT Element Tray Drawing.pdf drawing can be printed out at 100% size to help mark out the hole pattern. Label the rows with numbers and columns with letters using a permenant marker. Load the tray with PZT elements.

Sometimes the silver electrodes are not cut neatly to the edge of the PZT. The excess PZT electrode material can fold over onto itself during shipping and handling. The excess electrode can affect the thickness measurement of the PZT elements and can prevent the PZT elements from seating properly on the bottom face of the slots in the PVA mould during matching layer deposition. To fix this, the electrode edges should be \"dressed\" by scraping away the excess electrode material. Note: Perform this work underneath a microscope. For each PZT element: Remove the PZT element from the tray using tweezers. Hold the PZT element on a flat clean surface with the electrode facing upwards. Use a scalpel blade (Swann-Morton No.11) to gently chamfer the edges of the electrodes. Do not apply excessive downwards pressure with the scalpel. Do not touch the face of the electrode with the scalpel. placeholder for video Assess the PZT element for any defects. Possible defects are chipping (C), electrode delamination (E), sliced electrode (S), broken (B). Record these defects in spreadsheet pzt-element-dimensions-defects.xlsx .
