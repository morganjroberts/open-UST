# **open-UST:** An Open Source Manufacturing Framework for a Low-cost Ultrasound Tomography Research System.

There is a high barrier to entry for researchers starting ultrasound tomography (UST) experiments: UST hardware is not available off the shelf, and custom systems are expensive.
The goal of the open-UST project is to **lower the barrier to entry for experimental ultrasound tomography UST researchers.**

This research project is guided by three objectives:

1. Design a low cost UST research system and manufacture it in-house.
1. Measure its acoustic performance and imaging capability, and assess its overall suitability as a tool for the UST research community.
1. Release the design as an open-source hardware distribution.

If successful, this work will support researchers to build their own UST systems in house, accelerating progress towards fast and accurate UST imaging.

## Features

- **Simple end-user requirements:** No specialist equipment required, only a 3D-printer and vacuum chamber
- **Low material cost:** ~Â£2,500 (excluding DAQ hardware) for a 256-element system
- **Modular:** Both 2D and 3D imaging setups can be configured. Modules feature threaded mounting points for repeatable positioning
- **Durable:** Transducers are fully waterproof
- **Low interelement variation**: Recent testing showed that the individual sensing elements have uniform acoustic behaviour
